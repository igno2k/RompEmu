# Changelog

All notable changes to Romp are listed here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and Romp uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A choice of emulator for PlayStation, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, NES, Famicom and Famicom Disk System games in the Consoles tab of Settings. In-game saves sync under the chosen emulator's name, and SwanStation keeps memory card 1 as the game's save, like RetroArch.
- PS2 saves sync as a zip of the game's own save folders, the format Argosy and other RomM clients use, so a PS2 save moves between Romp and those clients. Downloads saved by Argosy's ARMSX2, NetherSX2 and AetherSX2 are accepted too.

### Changed

- On a Mac, each PS2 game keeps its saves on a PCSX2 folder memory card. A memory card image from an earlier Romp is converted once, and kept in the game's backup folder.
- PlayStation games play with SwanStation, Game Boy and Game Boy Color games with Gambatte, and NES, Famicom and Famicom Disk System games with Mesen, the emulators RetroDECK uses, so in-game saves move between the two. Beetle PSX HW, mGBA and Nestopia UE stay available in the Consoles tab of Settings.
- On Windows and Linux, GameCube, Wii, PSP, Dreamcast, PlayStation, N64 and PS2 games draw through Vulkan when the computer has a working Vulkan driver, and through OpenGL otherwise. N64 gets the accurate paraLLEl-RDP renderer, and the resolution settings in the Consoles tab.

### Fixed

- A PS2 save zip on the server is no longer written over a game's memory card, and a memory card is no longer uploaded where RomM's other clients expect a zip. A save Romp can't use is left alone, with the reason on the game page.
- A save file of the wrong size for the emulator, such as one from another emulator, is moved to the game's backup folder instead of being overwritten.
- When a game starts with a different emulator than last time, the other one's saves and save states are synced under its name and set aside, never loaded or uploaded by the new one. Between Beetle PSX HW and SwanStation, which share the memory card format, the in-game save stays. A game whose last emulator's saves can't sync first doesn't switch.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- A Licenses tab in the About window, with the license of Romp and of every emulator it downloads.
- Resolution settings on Macs for N64, GameCube and Wii, PlayStation, PSP and Dreamcast, and a 4x choice for PS2. They default to 2x, or 3x for PSP.
- PS2 memory cards sync with RomM like other in-game saves, and follow a game between ARMSX2 on a Mac and PCSX2 on Windows or Linux.

### Changed

- The About window is roomier and easier to read, and says who makes Romp.
- The audio library and other dependencies are up to date.

### Fixed

- PS2 games on Windows and Linux can save to their memory card. Each game now gets its own card in its save folder.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Romp updates ARMSX2 when a newer build is published.
- PS2 games on Macs render at three times their native resolution, with 16x anisotropic filtering.
- Save states are stored at their real size. ARMSX2's shrink from 68 MB to a few MB.
- On Macs, GameCube, Wii, PSP, Dreamcast and PlayStation games draw through Vulkan instead of Apple's outdated OpenGL.
- N64 games on Macs use the accurate paraLLEl-RDP renderer through Vulkan, in place of the slow software renderer.

### Added

- A Consoles tab in Settings, starting with PS2 resolution, anisotropic filtering and widescreen patches.

### Fixed

- PS2 games on Macs can save to their memory card, and pick up where you left off.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-28
